This section covers the RADR firmware, including architecture, development setup, and how to modify or contribute to the codebase.

## Firmware Overview

RADR runs on an ESP32-S3 microcontroller with custom firmware written in C++ using the Arduino framework and PlatformIO.

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| MCU | ESP32-S3 with PSRAM |
| Framework | Arduino for ESP32 |
| Build System | PlatformIO |
| Language | C++ |
| Display Library | TFT_eSPI |
| BLE Stack | NimBLE |

## Firmware Version

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Major Version | 1 |
| Minor Version | 0 |
| Patch Version | 24 |
| Full Version | 1.0.24 |

## Architecture Overview

### Main Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| State Machine | Manages screen states and navigation flow |
| Device Manager | Handles Bluetooth device discovery and connection |
| Display Driver | Renders UI using TFT_eSPI with canvas buffering |
| Input Handler | Processes encoder, button, and bumper inputs |
| Feedback System | Controls LEDs, buzzer, and vibration |
| Device Registry | Maps Bluetooth UUIDs to device types |

### Key Services

```

```

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PlatformIO Extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
- USB-C cable for flashing

### Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/researchanddesire/Open-Source-Wireless-Remote_RADR.git
cd Open-Source-Wireless-Remote_RADR
```

### Step 2: Open in VS Code

Open the `software/firmware/` folder, the PlatformIO project, in VS Code. PlatformIO detects the project from its `platformio.ini`.

### Step 3: Build the firmware

Click the PlatformIO Build button or run:
```bash
cd software/firmware
pio run -t buildprog
```

### Step 4: Flash to device

Connect RADR via USB-C and click Upload, or run from `software/firmware/`:
```bash
pio run --target upload
```

## Key Features

### Canvas-Based Rendering

RADR uses double-buffered canvas rendering for smooth display updates:

- Full-screen sprites prevent flickering
- Partial updates for performance-critical areas
- Consistent 60fps UI refresh rate

### State Machine Architecture

The UI uses a hierarchical state machine:

- Clear transitions between screens
- Isolated state logic for each screen
- Event-driven input handling

### Device Registry

RADR supports multiple device types through a two-tier registry:

| Registry | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Built-in | Hardcoded R+D device support (OSSM) |
| Dynamic | JSON-based Buttplug.io device definitions |

The dynamic registry (`registry.json`) can be updated via firmware updates to add new device support without code changes.

## Configuration Files

Paths are relative to `software/firmware/`.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `platformio.ini` | Build configuration and dependencies |
| `src/pins.h` | Hardware pin definitions |
| `src/constants.h` | Firmware constants |
| `data/registry.json` | Buttplug.io device UUID mappings |

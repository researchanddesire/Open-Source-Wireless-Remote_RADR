This document covers the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication protocols used by RADR to communicate with supported devices.

## BLE Overview

RADR uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for all device communication. As a BLE central device, RADR scans for and connects to peripheral devices like the OSSM and Lovense toys.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| BLE Role | Central |
| Device Name | OSSM-REMOTE |
| Transmit Power | 9 dBm |
| Stack | NimBLE |

## Scan Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Scan Interval | 100ms |
| Scan Window | 100ms |
| Scan Type | Active |
| Scan Duration | 5000ms (5 seconds) |

During active scanning, RADR sends scan request packets to devices to retrieve their full advertising data, including device names.

## Connection Parameters

RADR uses optimized connection parameters for responsive control:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Min Interval | 12 | 15ms minimum connection interval |
| Max Interval | 12 | 15ms maximum connection interval |
| Latency | 0 | No slave latency (immediate responses) |
| Supervision Timeout | 150 | 1500ms timeout for lost connections |
| Connect Timeout | 5000ms | Maximum time to establish connection |

The 15ms connection interval provides responsive control with minimal latency between encoder turns and device response.

## Device Discovery

RADR identifies supported devices by their advertised service UUIDs:

### Research And Desire Devices

| Device | Service UUID |
|--------|--------------|
| OSSM | `522B443A-4F53-534D-0001-420BADBABE69` |
| LKBX | Pending implementation |
| DTT | Pending implementation |

### Lovense Devices

| Device | Service UUID |
|--------|--------------|
| Domi 2 | `57300001-0023-4BD4-BBD5-A6920E4C5653` |
| Other | Via Buttplug.io registry |

### Buttplug.io Devices

Devices supported via the Buttplug.io protocol are identified using UUIDs from the dynamic registry (`registry.json`). This registry can be updated via firmware updates without code changes.

## OSSM Protocol

RADR communicates with OSSM using a custom BLE protocol:

### Service Structure

```
Service: 522B443A-4F53-534D-0001-420BADBABE69
├── Position Characteristic
├── Speed Characteristic
├── Depth Characteristic
├── Sensation Characteristic
├── Stroke Characteristic
└── Pattern Characteristic
```

### Command Format

Commands are sent as byte arrays to the appropriate characteristic:

| Parameter | Data Type | Range |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Speed | uint8_t | 0-100 |
| Depth | uint8_t | 0-100 |
| Sensation | uint8_t | 0-100 |
| Stroke | uint8_t | 0-100 |
| Pattern | uint8_t | Pattern index |

### Pattern Selection

Patterns are selected by index:

| Index | Pattern Name |
|-------|--------------|
| 0 | Simple Stroke |
| 1 | Teasing Pounding |
| 2 | Robo Stroke |
| 3 | Half'n'Half |
| 4 | Deeper |
| 5 | Stop'n'Go |
| 6 | Insist |

## Lovense Protocol

For Lovense devices with direct integration (Domi), RADR uses the Lovense BLE protocol:

### Vibration Control

```
Command: Vibrate:{level};
Level: 0-16
```

### Battery Query

```
Command: Battery;
Response: {percentage}
```

### Power Control

```
Command: PowerOff;
```

## Buttplug.io Devices

For devices supported via Buttplug.io, RADR implements a subset of the Buttplug protocol:

- **Vibrate** — Set vibration level (0-1 float, mapped to device range)
- **Linear** — For thrusting devices
- **Rotate** — For rotating devices

Not all devices support all commands. RADR queries device capabilities during connection.

## Connection Recovery

If RADR loses connection to a device:

1. **Detection** — Connection loss detected within supervision timeout (1500ms)
2. **Reconnection** — Automatic reconnection attempt within 2-5 seconds
3. **Safety** — For OSSM, gradual ramp-down during disconnection
4. **Failure** — After failed reconnection, return to main menu

## Security

RADR uses open BLE connections without pairing or bonding:

- No PIN required
- No encryption (commands are plaintext)
- Single connection at a time

!!! warning
    BLE communications are not encrypted. Use RADR in private settings where radio interception is not a concern.

## Debugging

For BLE debugging during development:

1. Use a BLE sniffer (nRF Connect, Wireshark with BLE adapter)
2. Enable serial logging in firmware (`LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG`)
3. Monitor connection events and characteristic writes
